**FormML** (Form Modeling Language, pronounced as "formal") is a full-stack framework for building **enterprise-level** forms.

It's under active development now and currently provides official **React** bindings.

## Motivation

Forms can be **simple** (a sign-up or a survey) or **complex** (a loan application or a tax return). While there are many powerful tools in the ecosystem for building basic forms, such as [Formik](https://formik.org/) and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/), there isn't yet a serious solution (to my knowledge) that specifically addresses the pain points of complex forms - the **Enterprise-Level** forms.

### What's the Enterprise-Level Forms?

Imagine you're a financial company building an online loan application form. What challenges might you face?

- **Non-Tech Stakeholders Driven**: Loans are serious business involving specialized knowledge across finance, accounting, and legal domains - knowledge typically held only by **non-technical experts**. A key challenge is enabling these stakeholders to lead form design while maintaining smooth collaboration with developers.
- **Branded UI & Custom UX**: Developers matter too! Companies don't want cookie-cutter form designs. Every serious enterprise wants to build their brand and deliver unique user experiences, goals that require developer expertise to achieve.
- **Calculations, Formulas & Dynamic Behavior**: Loan amounts, monthly payments and other fields need real-time calculation through formulas. Different fields also need to be shown or hidden based on the selected "loan type".
- **Auto-save & Resume**: Complex forms can have hundreds of fields - users don't want to start over if they accidentally close their browser.
- **Others**: Performance, validation, prefilling, and more.

These aren't niche problems specific to certain scenarios, but common challenges enterprises face when building complex forms. We call all the forms with similar pain points "**Enterprise-Level**" forms.

### How Does FormML Address These?

- **Non-Tech Stakeholders Driven** ‚û°Ô∏è **Non-Dev Friendly DSL**: As its full name "Form Modeling Language" suggests, FormML's core is a DSL for modeling forms. It was designed from the ground up for non-developers, with simple structure, minimal syntax, and more natural terminology (e.g., "text" instead of "string").
- **Branded UI & Custom UX** ‚û°Ô∏è **Model-View Separation**: FormML DSL focuses on modeling form business logic. Once the model (`.formml` file) is complete, UI/view implementation is entirely in developers' hands and fully customizable.
- **Calculations, Formulas & Dynamic Behavior** ‚û°Ô∏è **First-class dynamic forms support** & **Excel-like formula** (WIP)
- **Auto-save & Resume** ‚û°Ô∏è **First-class real-time forms support** (WIP)
- **Others**: Performance (reactivity system based on [@vue/reactivity](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/reactivity)), validation (annotations based on [valibot](https://valibot.dev/)), prefilling (plugin system)

## Getting Started

> üí° You may not need to read everything
>
> - üìù For non-technical people (FormML Model authors): You only need to understand the [Create Your First FormML Model](#create-your-first-formml-model) section
> - üë®‚Äçüíª For developers: It's recommended to read all

### Create Your First FormML Model

At its core, FormML features a non-developers friendly DSL (Domain-Specific Language) designed to describe form structure, types, and logic. These descriptions are typically written in one (or a set of) `.fml` files. All form definitions within `.fml` files together constitute a "FormML Model".

Let's create your first FormML Model step by step.

1. Install and open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the FormML extension (VSCode only for now)
3. Create a `sign-up.fml` file anywhere
4. Enter the following content:

```kotlin
form SignUp {
  text     name
  text     email
  text     password
  datetime birthday
}
```

Congratulations! You've just created a simplest FormML Model.

<details>
<summary>Explanation for beginners</summary>

This code demonstrates 2 core syntactic elements of FormML DSL:

- `form SignUp { ... }`: Defines a form named `SignUp`, with its contents enclosed within the `{ ... }` code block
- `text name`: Defines a form field named `name` of type `text`

</details>

In FormML DSL, fields are optional by default (since required fields are typically the minority in complex forms).

To make a field required, you can add the `@required` annotation. Let's make `name`, `email`, and `password` required:

```kotlin
form SignUp {
  @required
  text     name
  @required
  text     email
  @required
  text     password
  datetime birthday
}
```

Now these three fields cannot be empty, or users will see error messages.

We can further enhance field validation by adding more annotations or modifying annotation parameters:

```kotlin
form SignUp {
  @required("Let me know your cool name!")
  text     name
  @required @email
  text     email
  @required @minLength(8)
  text     password
  datetime birthday
}
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation for beginners</summary>

Here's what we changed/added:

- `@required("Let me know your cool name!")`: Added a new parameter to `name` field's `@required` annotation, that specifies a custom error message
- `@email`: Added the `@email` annotation to `email` field to validate text format
- `@minLength(8)`: Added the `@minLength` annotation with parameter 8 to `password` field to enforce a minimum length of 8 characters

</details>

Perfect! You now have your first complete FormML Model. For more FormML DSL syntax, please refer to the [FormML DSL Reference](#formml-dsl-reference) section.

### Create UI

Once you have your FormML Model ready (either written by yourself or from non-technical experts), you can start to create your form UI with React now.

> üí° FormML itself is framework agnostic. But for now, only React bindings are ready.

To import `.fml` files directly into your JS/TS files, you'll need to complete these 2 setups firstly:

<details>
<summary>Set up your bundler</summary>

FormML provides a Vite/Rollup plugin for importing `.fml` files in JavaScript (other bundlers support is coming soon). Here's how to set it up with Vite (Rollup configuration is similar):

1 - Install the plugin

```bash
npm install rollup-plugin-formml --save-dev
```

2 - Edit your `vite.config.ts` file to enable the plugin:

```ts
...
import formml from 'rollup-plugin-formml'

export default defineConfig({
  ...
  plugins: [formml()],
})
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Set up TypeScript</summary>

To provide real-time type checking (even after editing `.fml` files), FormML uses [TypeScript's Language Service Plugin](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Writing-a-Language-Service-Plugin) feature. Here's how to set it up:

> See [Why not code generation?](#why-not-code-generation) to learn the reason of this decision.

> TypeScript Language Service Plugin [only affects your editing experience](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Writing-a-Language-Service-Plugin#whats-a-language-service-plugin), meaning FormML Model's type information won't be included when running the `tsc` command.
>
> For more information, see: [Using `tsc` to check FormML Model types](#using-tsc-to-check-formml-model-types).

1 - (For VSCode users) VSCode defaults to using the global TypeScript version which won't load the plugin correctly. Configure VSCode to [use the workspace version of TypeScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling#_using-the-workspace-version-of-typescript)

2 - Install the FormML TypeScript plugin

```bash
npm install @formml/ts-plugin --save-dev
```

3 - Edit your `tsconfig.json` file to enable the plugin:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [{ "name": "@formml/ts-plugin" }]
  }
}
```

4 - Restart TS Server to see type information
