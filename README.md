**FormML** (Form Modeling Language, pronounced as "formal") is a full-stack framework for building **enterprise-level** forms.

It's under active development now and currently provides official **React** bindings.

## Motivation

Forms can be **simple** (a sign-up or a survey) or **complex** (a loan application or a tax return). While there are many powerful tools in the ecosystem for building basic forms, such as [Formik](https://formik.org/) and [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/), there isn't yet a serious solution (to my knowledge) that specifically addresses the pain points of complex forms - the **Enterprise-Level** forms.

### What's the Enterprise-Level Forms?

Imagine you're a financial company building an online loan application form. What challenges might you face?

- **Non-Tech Stakeholder Involvement**: Loans are serious business involving specialized knowledge across finance, accounting, and legal domains - knowledge typically held only by **non-technical experts**. A key challenge is enabling these stakeholders to lead form design while maintaining smooth collaboration with developers.
- **Branded UI & Custom UX**: Developers matter too! Companies don't want cookie-cutter form designs. Every serious enterprise wants to build their brand and deliver unique user experiences, goals that require developer expertise to achieve.
- **Calculations, Formulas & Dynamic Behavior**: Loan amounts, monthly payments and other fields need real-time calculation through formulas. Different fields also need to be shown or hidden based on the selected "loan type".
- **Auto-save & Resume**: Complex forms can have hundreds of fields - users don't want to start over if they accidentally close their browser.
- **Others**: Performance, validation, prefilling, and more.

These aren't niche problems specific to certain scenarios, but common challenges enterprises face when building complex forms. We call all the forms with similar pain points "**Enterprise-Level**" forms.

### How Does FormML Address These?

- **Non-Tech Stakeholder Involvement** ‚û°Ô∏è **Non-Dev Friendly DSL**: As its full name "Form Modeling Language" suggests, FormML's core is a DSL for modeling forms. It was designed from the ground up for non-developers, with simple structure, minimal syntax, and more natural terminology (e.g., "text" instead of "string").
- **Branded UI & Custom UX** ‚û°Ô∏è **Model-View Separation**: FormML DSL focuses on modeling form business logic. Once the model (`.fml` file) is complete, UI/view implementation is entirely in developers' hands and fully customizable.
- **Calculations, Formulas & Dynamic Behavior** ‚û°Ô∏è **First-class dynamic forms support** & **Excel-like formula** (WIP)
- **Auto-save & Resume** ‚û°Ô∏è **First-class real-time forms support** (WIP)
- **Others**: Performance (reactivity system based on [@vue/reactivity](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/reactivity)), validation (annotations based on [valibot](https://valibot.dev/)), prefilling (plugin system)

## Getting Started

> üí° You may not need to read everything
>
> - üìù For non-technical people (FormML Model authors): You only need to understand the [Create Your First FormML Model](#create-your-first-formml-model) section
> - üë®‚Äçüíª For developers: It's recommended to read all

### Create Your First FormML Model

At its core, FormML features a non-developers friendly DSL (Domain-Specific Language) designed to describe form structure, types, and logic. These descriptions are typically written in one (or a set of) `.fml` files. All form definitions within `.fml` files together constitute a _FormML Model_.

Let's create your first FormML Model step by step.

1. Install and open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the FormML extension (VSCode only for now)
3. Create a `sign-up.fml` file anywhere
4. Enter the following content:

```java
form SignUp {
  text     name
  text     email
  text     password
  datetime birthday
}
```

Congratulations! You've just created a simplest FormML Model.

<details>
<summary>Explanation for beginners</summary>

This code demonstrates 2 core syntactic elements of FormML DSL:

- `form SignUp { ... }`: Defines a form named `SignUp`, with its contents enclosed within the `{ ... }` code block
- `text name`: Defines a form field named `name` of type `text`

</details>

In FormML DSL, fields are **optional** by default (since required fields are typically the minority in complex forms).

To make a field required, you can add the `@required` annotation. Let's make `name`, `email`, and `password` required:

```java
form SignUp {
  @required
  text     name
  @required
  text     email
  @required
  text     password
  datetime birthday
}
```

Now these three fields cannot be empty, or users will see error messages.

We can further enhance field validation by adding more annotations or modifying annotation parameters:

```java
form SignUp {
  @required("Let me know your cool name!")
  text     name
  @required @email
  text     email
  @required @minLength(8)
  text     password
  datetime birthday
}
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation for beginners</summary>

Here's what we changed/added:

- `@required("Let me know your cool name!")`: Added a new parameter to `name` field's `@required` annotation, that specifies a custom error message
- `@email`: Added the `@email` annotation to `email` field to validate text format
- `@minLength(8)`: Added the `@minLength` annotation with parameter 8 to `password` field to enforce a minimum length of 8 characters

</details>

Perfect! You now have your first complete FormML Model. For more FormML DSL syntax, please refer to the [FormML DSL Reference](#formml-dsl-reference) section.

### Create UI

Once you have your FormML Model ready (either written by yourself or from non-technical experts), you can start to create your form UI with React now.

> üí° FormML itself is framework agnostic. But for now only the React bindings is ready.

To import `.fml` files directly into your JS/TS files, you'll need to complete these 2 setups firstly:

<details>
<summary>Set up your bundler</summary>

FormML provides a Vite/Rollup plugin for importing `.fml` files in JavaScript (other bundlers support is coming soon). Here's how to set it up with Vite (Rollup configuration is similar):

1 - Install the plugin

```bash
npm install rollup-plugin-formml --save-dev
```

2 - Edit your `vite.config.ts` file to enable the plugin:

```ts
...
import formml from 'rollup-plugin-formml'

export default defineConfig({
  ...
  plugins: [formml()],
})
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Set up TypeScript</summary>

To provide real-time type checking (even after editing `.fml` files), FormML uses [TypeScript's Language Service Plugin](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Writing-a-Language-Service-Plugin) feature. Here's how to set it up:

> See [Why not code generation?](#why-not-code-generation) to learn the reason of this decision.

> TypeScript Language Service Plugin [only affects your editing experience](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Writing-a-Language-Service-Plugin#whats-a-language-service-plugin), meaning FormML Model's type information won't be included when running the `tsc` command.
>
> For more information, see: [Using `tsc` to check FormML Model types](#using-tsc-to-check-formml-model-types).

1 - (For VSCode users) VSCode defaults to using the global TypeScript version which won't load the plugin correctly. Configure VSCode to [use the workspace version of TypeScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling#_using-the-workspace-version-of-typescript)

2 - Install the FormML TypeScript plugin

```bash
npm install @formml/ts-plugin --save-dev
```

3 - Edit your `tsconfig.json` file to enable the plugin:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [{ "name": "@formml/ts-plugin" }]
  }
}
```

4 - Restart TS Server to see type information

> If your **ESLint** fails due to some `.fml` and `typescript-eslint` related errors, refer to this [troubleshooting](#typescript-eslint-cannot-resolve-fml-file-types) section for potential fixes.

</details>

Next, create your first form component with FormML Model.

1 - Install FormML React bindings

```bash
npm install @formml/react --save
```

2 - Create a `SignUpForm.tsx` file then display your first field:

```jsx
import { Field, ErrorMessage, useFormML } from '@formml/react'

// import `.fml` directly and enjoy real-time type checking
import SignUp from './sign-up.fml'

export default function App() {
  const { $form, FormML, handleSubmit } = useFormML(SignUp)

  // "handleSubmit" will validate inputs before invoking real "onSubmit"
  const onSubmit = handleSubmit(data => console.log(data))

  return (
    {/* "FormML" - a context provider */}
    <FormML>
      <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
        <label>Name</label>

        {/* "Field" - a smart input component that binds to FormML Model field via `$form.name` */}
        <Field $bind={$form.name} />

        {/* "ErrorMessage" - a helper component that displays error message for the field */}
        <ErrorMessage $bind={$form.name} as="span" />

        <button>Submit</button>
      </form>
    </FormML>
  )
}
```

Congratulations! You've just created your first FormML form. Integrate it into your app and run `vite dev` to see the result now!

Learn more details by expanding below sections.

<details>
<summary>Understanding <code>$form.name</code> and <i>field indexes</i>: How do they enable the <strong>next-level</strong> type safety?</summary>

We call `$form.name` above a _field index_. It's a tool for referencing a FormML Model field in JavaScript, and is typically passed as the `$bind` prop to components like `Field` and `ErrorMessage`.

Unlike string-based indexing approaches (used by Formik, React Hook Form, etc.), field indexes are generated from the FormML Model (with real-time type information provided through the TS plugin), enabling truly next-level type safety.

This next-level type safety manifests in three ways:

1 - Type-Based Completion

`$form` is known as the _index root_ - think of it as an index pointing to the entire form, making it the root of all child indexes.

Crucially, it's fully typed, so when you access its children via dot notation, VSCode automatically lists all possible child indexes.

(image)

This feature will also apply to planned _FormML Model composite types_, providing autocompletion when writing nested paths like `$form.parent.child`.

2 - Field-Level Type Checking

`$form.name` has type `TextIndex` because it's defined as `text name` in the FormML Model.

Therefore, if you have a custom `DatePicker` component (introduced in the next section) that only accepts `datetime` fields, `$form.name` cannot be passed to it:

```tsx
function DatePicker(props: { $bind: DatetimeIndex }) {
  ...
}

<DatePicker $bind={$form.name} /> {/* TS Error: "$form.name" is not of type DatetimeIndex */}
```

3 - Enabling Truly **Reusable** Form Components

This is where field indexes truly shine!

Field indexes provide an interface layer that decouples specific form content from generic form components, making components genuinely reusable.

For example, the `DatePicker` component above depends on the `DatetimeIndex` type rather than any specific form, so it can be reused across different scenarios - like `birthday` in a sign-up form, `dueDate` in a todo-list form, etc.

> üéÅ Planned _FormML Model composite types_ will take reusability to new heights:
>
> FormML Models will be able to group related fields into new composite types. Meanwhile generic components can also declare which fields they depend on.
>
> Type compatibility checks are then left entirely to TypeScript.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Creating custom field components with <code>useField</code> hook</summary>

Let's create a custom `DatePicker` component mentioned above using the `useField` hook:

```tsx
function DatePicker(props: { $bind: DatetimeIndex }) {
  const { field, meta } = useField(props.$bind)
  return (
    <>
      <input type="datetime-local" {...field} /> {/* Includes `name`, `value`, `onChange`, `onBlur` */}
      {meta.error && <span>{meta.error.message}</span>}
      {meta.touched && <span>Ta-Da!</span>}
    </>
  )
}
```

> üìù For more details about `useField` API, please refer to [API Reference](#api-reference).

FormML implements a reactivity system based on [@vue/reactivity](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/reactivity). When form state updates occur, FormML ensures components only re-render when their specifically watched states change.

</details>

### Server-side Validation

FormML is full-stack - you can use the same FormML Model to validate form submissions on the server side.

> Before starting, make sure you've completed the bundler and TypeScript setup as described in the previous [Create UI](#create-ui) section.

1 - Install `@formml/core`

```bash
npm install @formml/core --save
```

2 - Use the `parse` function to validate and transform data ([Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) example)

```ts
import express from 'express'
import { parse } from '@formml/core'
import SignUp from './sign-up.fml'

const app = express()

app.post('/sign-up', (req, res) => {
  // Assuming form data is submitted as JSON
  // Validate & parse plain object into rich object
  const data = parse(req.body, SignUp)
  res.status(201).end()
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000')
})
```

Each primitive type in FormML Model has its corresponding [JavaScript type](#primitive-types). The `parse` function will first validate the data according to the FormML Model definition, then convert plain data to rich types.

```ts
const data = {
  name: 'John',
  email: 'john@example.com',
  password: 'password',
  birthday: '1999-12-31T00:00:00.000Z',
}

const result = parse(data, SignUp) // Converts string => Date
// result is:
// {
//   name: "John",
//   email: "john@example.com",
//   password: "password",
//   birthday: Date("1999-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"),
// }
```

If validation fails, the `parse` function will throw an error.

> üìù For more information about the `parse` function, please refer to the [API Reference](#api-reference).

> FormML also provides `safeParse` and `validate` functions for different scenarios. See the [API Reference](#api-reference) for details.

## FormML Model (DSL) Reference

**FormML Model** refers to the `.fml` file(s) that define a form's structure, types, and logic with FormML DSL.

For basic knowledge and how to create a new FormML Model, please refer to the [Create Your First FormML Model](#create-your-first-formml-model) section.

### `form` Block

Every FormML Model starts with a `form` block. Each model can only contain **one** `form` block as its unique entry point.

**Syntax**

```java
form [name] {
  ...
  [fields]
  ...
}
```

**Elements**

- `[name]`: A unique name for the form. Can be ASCII letters, numbers, and underscores, but **cannot start with a number**. (Use [pascal case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PascalCase) conventionally)
- `[fields]`: One or more [field definitions](#field)

### Field

Defines a form field inside a `form` block.

**Syntax**

```java
@[annotations]
[type] [name]
```

**Elements**

- `@[annotations]`: Zero or more [annotations](#annotation)
- `[type]`: The type of the field. Can be a [primitive type](#primitive-type) or a [composite type](#composite-type) (WIP).
- `[name]`: The unique name of the field. Can be ASCII letters, numbers, and underscores, but **cannot start with a number**. (Use [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) conventionally)

#### Primitive Type

##### `text`

Represents a piece of textual content in any language (e.g., a name, email, or bio).

> Runtime JavaScript type: `string`

##### `num`

Represents a **general-purpose** number value (e.g., a quantity, age, or score).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It follows the [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floating-point representation under the hood. You may encounter **precision issues** when using it to represent **currency** or other high precision values.
>
> For that purpose, refer to the [`decimal`](#decimal) type instead.

> Runtime JavaScript type: `number`

##### `bool`

Represents a [boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type) (an either/or choice) value (e.g., true/false, yes/no).

> Runtime JavaScript type: `boolean`

##### `decimal`

Represents a **decimal** number value that won't lose precision on arithmetic operations (except for division). It's suitable for representing **currency** or other high precision values (e.g., a price, tax, or payment).

> For general number scenarios that don't require high precision, use [`num`](#num) type instead.

> Runtime JavaScript type: [`BigNumber`](https://mikemcl.github.io/bignumber.js/)

##### `datetime`

Represents a date, time, or date & time value.

> Runtime JavaScript type: `Date`

#### Composite Type

WIP

#### Annotation

Annotations are optional modifiers that can be added to a field to enhance its behavior. Typically they are used for further validation beyond basic field type checks.

**Syntax**

```java
@[name]([arguments])
```

**Elements**

- `[name]`: The name of the annotation. Refer to the [Annotation Reference](#annotation-reference) for the full list.
- `[arguments]`: Zero or more arguments passed to the annotation. See examples below for more details.

**Examples**

You can omit optional parameters.

```java
@required() // omit optional param `message`
text name
```

If no arguments, you can also omit the parentheses.

```java
@required
text name
```

You can pass arguments namelessly,

```java
@maxLength(10, "Up to 10 characters")
text name
```

...or named-ly,

```java
@maxLength(length: 10, message: "Up to 10 characters")
text name
```

...with any order.

```java
@maxLength(message: "Up to 10 characters", length: 10)
text name
```

Of course you can mix them together,

```java
@maxLength(10, message: "Up to 10 characters")
text name
```

...but remember, named arguments can only come after all positional arguments.

```java
@maxLength(length: 10, "Up to 10 characters") // Error: Named argument can only appear after all positional arguments.
text name
```

## FAQs

### Comparison with X

I explained the motivation of FormML in detail in blog [Beyond Basic Forms: Why Enterprise-Level Forms Remain a Challenge](./docs/blog/enterprise-level-forms.md).

There are some comparisons with awesome tools in the ecosystem like React Hook Form.

If you are still confused, welcome to new a discussion in this repo.

### Why not code generation?

When implementing type support for FormML DSL, I had two choices with different pros and cons:

- Code generation: Like [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), create a CLI to manually or semi-automatically generate type files in the filesystem.
- TypeScript language service plugin: Leverage TypeScript's native capabilities to provide real-time type support in the editor.

Neither solution is perfect. For example, the current approach (option 2) cannot support type checking in `tsc` (see [Using `tsc` to check FormML Model types](#using-tsc-to-check-formml-model-types)).

However, code generation has some significant drawbacks I couldn't accept:

- Whether visible or not, it always shits in your filesystem - managing these files has costs, both for users and FormML itself.
- It brings additional mental burden - requiring users to switch contexts (their code vs generated code).
- It adds complexity to CI/CD - extra build steps, more dependencies.
- Real-time updates require extra background process, or you have to do it by hands.

So I chose option 2 without much hesitation.

To be honest, while the ts-plugin has worked well so far, I'm still not entirely confident in this approach. This is mainly due to the TypeScript team's inaction on the plugin system (it has minimal documentation, limited functionality, and more importantly, the team doesn't seem very interested in it).

The good news is that FormML can always switch to option 1 in the future if we encounter insurmountable issues, since this is just one minor aspect of FormML. üòâ

### Using `tsc` to check FormML Model types

Due to the [limitation of TypeScript language service plugin](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Writing-a-Language-Service-Plugin), it's impossible to provide type infos of `.fml` files when running `tsc` cli.

That is, if you rely on `tsc` (directly or indirectly) to check types (mostly in CI/CD), you may get errors like:

```
error TS2307: Cannot find module 'xxx.fml' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

A mitigation is to create a `.d.ts` file to basically skip all type checks for `.fml` files, like:

```ts
// formml.d.ts
declare module '*.fml' {
  const model: any
  export default model
}
```

Place it anywhere in your project, and ensure it's included by your `tsconfig.json`.

Now you can run `tsc` without errors.

To resolve this issue completely, I plan to create a cli with command like `formml check` to replace `tsc --noEmit` for type checking.

### `typescript-eslint` cannot resolve `.fml` file types

If you are using "Linting with Type Information" feature of `typescript-eslint`, it may fail due to `typescript-eslint` cannot resolve `.fml` file types correctly, even though TypeScript itself can.

To fix this, please ensure `parserOptions.project: true` is set in your ESLint config (more details [here](https://typescript-eslint.io/packages/parser#project)). This enables `typescript-eslint` to have the completely same type information as TypeScript.
